Your primary tasks will be to:

- build a pendulum,
- use theoretical equations (from physics) to calculate the period of the pendulum,
- collect real-world experimental data from your pendulum,
- create a computer simulation of your pendulum numerically,
- plot and extract meaningful results 2 through 4

Your final submission should include (on GitHub):

All of your updated Python files
A README.md file explaining what .py files to run to get your results
A .pdf file containing your final plots and a brief report and discussion of results
At least five micro:bit data files from a pendulum for testing your parsing code.
