# Project1 Part 4 Goes Here

This code was created by Megan and Tori. 
This code inputs experimental data in csv files about the accelerations in the x, y, and z directions at specific times. 
With this data file, it then plots these x, y, and z accelerations by time in seconds (m/s^2). 
It also calculates the change in theta for the pendulum and plots those by time as well (degrees/second). 
It is important to note that the user must change the path to their own personal computer and when changing files input the new name of the file whose data you are trying to plot.
It also calculates the period of the pendulum based on the change in time between peaks of the y-acceleration graph.    

The final name of this code is Length 1 Plotter.py

Each csv file corresponds to data collected by the microbit of pendulums at a certain length specified in Part 2
